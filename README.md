# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.
## PROMPTS GIVEN :
 ## TASK MANAGEMENT : 
You are an expert Full-Stack Application Developer and AI Architect. Your task is to interpret the following requirements and generate a complete, functional, mobile-first Task Management Application that uses AI for intelligent planning and prioritization.
## SMART SCHEDULER : 

ROLE: You are an Expert Productivity and Time Management Assistant. Your goal is to eliminate scheduling conflict, maximize focus time, and ensure all high-priority tasks are scheduled before their deadlines.
## WELNESS TIP :
The AI Application Development Engine

TASK: Integrate a new feature called "Wellness Coach" into the existing Task Manager application, following the specifications below.

ROLE: Act as the Wellness Coach Module Developer. Your primary responsibility is to create the logic and necessary UI components for proactive, context-aware wellness intervention.

## MOOD TRACKER :

Integrate a simple, user-initiated Mood Tracking Feature into the Task Manager app. The primary goal is to capture the user's emotional state and contextual data in a structured, consistent format.

System Role and Feature Goal
ROLE: Act as the Mood Tracker Module Developer. Your responsibility is to design the UI/UX flow for capturing mood data and defining the structured output schema.

FEATURE NAME: Mood

GOAL: Provide a simple interface for the user to log their current mood and emotional context, then store this data for later correlation with task performance and scheduling.

FEATURE NAME: Wellness Coach Tips

GOAL: Generate a single, concise, and highly relevant wellness tip to reduce user stress, prevent burnout, and improve focus, based on their real-time schedule and task performance.
